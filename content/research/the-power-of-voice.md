## Introduction

In 2024, Shashank from India set a record by typing the alphabet in just 3.25 seconds. Around the same time, Omkar Palav, an IT professional from Mumbai, made headlines by typing the alphabet with his nose in 20.51 seconds. And let's not forget MythicalRocket, a teenager who achieved an incredible 305 words per minute over a 15-second span.

These are fascinating stories, to be sure. These individuals are remarkable outliers in a sea of over 8 billion people. For the vast majority of us, typing at such speeds is not natural, nor are we training to win ‘fastest typer’ battles. This leads to an important question: what is the most natural and effortless way for us to communicate? How quickly can we truly transform our thoughts into words? If you’re like most people, you were probably subvocalizing—or mouthing—the sentences above as you read them.

## The Speed of Speech vs Typing

For most people, talking is significantly faster and more fluid than typing, especially in casual or conversational settings. While typing can be more efficient for precision and editing, speaking generally wins in terms of raw speed. A notable Stanford study found that speech recognition in English can reach about 161 words per minute, compared to an average typing speed of just 53 words per minute. The gap is similar in other languages; in Mandarin, for instance, speech input averages 108 WPM, while typing lags at around 38 WPM.

## Why Speaking Feels More Natural: Evolution and Physiology

The reason speaking feels so much more intuitive than typing is deeply rooted in our biology and evolution. Let’s break it down:

**1. Evolutionary Foundation**
Speech is an ancient human ability; while writing and typing are recent inventions.

- **Speech** likely evolved between 50,000 to 100,000 years ago, emerging from our need for complex social cooperation.
- **Writing** appeared only about 5,000 years ago, and **typing** is less than 200 years old.
- This means our brains are fundamentally wired for speech. It's an innate biological adaptation, as noted by thinkers like Steven Pinker and Noam Chomsky. Infants learn to speak spontaneously, but no child naturally learns to type without formal instruction.

**2. Physiological Efficiency**

- **Speaking** involves the automatic, fluid coordination of about 100 muscles in the tongue, lips, larynx, and diaphragm. This process is managed by optimized brain regions like Broca’s area.
- **Typing**, by contrast, requires fine motor control, conscious effort, and constant visual-spatial feedback to coordinate the eyes and hands, making it a less efficient process.

**3. Cognitive Load and Thought Flow**

- **Speech** is streamlined: we think and vocalize almost simultaneously.
- **Typing** requires a complex, serial process: thought → language → motor action → visual verification. This higher cognitive load is why ideas often flow more freely when we speak to them aloud.

A 2019 Stanford HCI study supports this, finding that speech input allowed participants to express ideas three times faster than typing. Brain imaging also shows less mental effort is required for spontaneous speech compared to written composition.

## Embracing a Voice-First Future

We already use our voice everywhere-in conversations with friends, during quick check-ins with colleagues, and when summoning AI assistants on our devices.

Now, imagine removing the friction of typing entirely. Picture drafting detailed emails, crafting complex AI prompts, or brainstorming groundbreaking ideas *exactly* as you’d chat with a friend-effortless, natural, and fast.

Advanced voice technology unlocks that possibility, turning your spoken words into powerful, searchable content.

Here’s what you could do with it:

- **Translation:** Speak once and see it accurately converted into text across multiple languages.
- **Command:** Ask questions and get instant, contextual answers-without lifting a finger.
- **Custom Vocabulary:** Teach the AI your unique jargon, industry terms, and even your personal phrases.
- **Dictionary Shortcuts:** Use a single word to instantly drop in URLs, email templates, or addresses.
- **Ask Anywhere:** Inquire about anything on your screen, and the AI will analyze, and respond-no copy-pasting required.

This isn’t science fiction-it’s the natural next step in how we work, learn, and create. By harnessing the effortless power of our voice, we move faster, think clearer, and connect deeper.

If this inspires you, don’t just imagine it-_experience it_.

Unlock the tools to work smarter, study better, and think out loud.
