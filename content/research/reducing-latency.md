## Introduction

Low latency is critical for natural voice interaction experiences. This research explores optimization techniques to achieve sub-100ms response times.

## Pipeline Optimization

Our approach focuses on optimizing every stage of the inference pipeline.

### Preprocessing Optimization

- **Streaming audio processing**: Process audio chunks as they arrive
- **Parallel feature extraction**: Utilize multiple CPU cores efficiently
- **Optimized FFT implementation**: Custom SIMD-accelerated transforms

## Model Compression Techniques

We employ several model compression techniques to reduce inference time without sacrificing accuracy.

## Results

Our optimized pipeline achieves consistent sub-100ms latency across various hardware configurations.

## Conclusion

Through careful optimization at every stage, sub-100ms latency is achievable on consumer hardware.
